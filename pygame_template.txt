Plan for game:

- Frogger-type game
- Will need two types of Sprites: player and enemies
- Goal: Move player from bottom of the screen to the top without touching enemy
- Score: Point for each time player makes it to the top of the screen (increase speed of enemies and bump player back to bottom after each point)
- If time, add coin collection for bonus points
- Not sure what sound to use yet
